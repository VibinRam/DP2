### The clustering of Active Galactic Nuclei

Q. Why are we interested in studying the spatial clusturing of the AGN? 
- Physical nature of host galaxy
- conditions causing infall and growth of the black hole
- To compare with galaxy clusters to see how the two are related

Clustering is quantified by measuring the [[correlation function]] $\xi(r)$. The galaxy correlation function at low redshift has been precisely measured using data from [[SDSS]]. Current cosmological model can give a detailed prediction of $\xi_{DM}$. 

Q. What is the relationship between [[threshold bias models]] and galaxy or AGN clustering? $$\xi_{gal} = b^2 \xi_{DM}$$
where $b$ may depend on the scale.

Q. How can we determine the characteristic mass of the dark matter halos associated with a given sample of galaxies from a measurement of their clustering?
