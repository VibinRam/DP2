#### Abstract
- Extension of the 2014 paper.
- more numerous cool dwarfs.
- PS1 has 124 quasars in $5.6 \lesssim z \lesssim 6.7$ that satisfy the Banados selection criteria
- 77 discovered with PS1 and 63 newly discovered in this paper.

#### Conclusion
- The search is not complete. Still going on at the time of this paper.
- Looks into how common weak emission line quasars are at high redshift. 
	- Following [Diamond-Stanic et al. 2009], find that 13.7% of the quasars in this paper are weak-line quasars, a larger fraction than what is found at lower redshift.
	- Not a conclusive result.

#### Introduction
- Short and crisp
- First $z > 5.6$ quasars were discovered by [Fan et al. 2000].
