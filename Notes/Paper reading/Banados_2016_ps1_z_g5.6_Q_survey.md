#### Abstract
- Extension of the 2014 paper.
- more numerous cool dwarfs.
- PS1 has 124 quasars in $5.6 \lesssim z \lesssim 6.7$ that satisfy the Banados selection criteria
- 77 discovered with PS1 and 63 newly discovered in this paper.

#### Conclusion
- The search is not complete. Still going on at the time of this paper.
- Looks into how common weak emission line quasars are at high redshift. 
	- Following [Diamond-Stanic et al. 2009], find that 13.7% of the quasars in this paper are weak-line quasars, a larger fraction than what is found at lower redshift.
	- Not a conclusive result.

#### Introduction
- Short and crisp
- First $z > 5.6$ quasars were discovered by [Fan et al. 2000].

#### Rest-frame $1450 \overset{\circ}{A}$ magnitudes
- $1450 \overset{\circ}{A}$ is important for the estimation of QLF
- shifted to observed wavelength > $9570 \overset{\circ}{A}$, out of optical
- We can extrapolate to $1450 \overset{\circ}{A}$ from $y_{p1}$ and J bands, using the continuum equation $f_\nu = C \times \nu^{\alpha_\nu}$ .
- $\alpha_\nu = -0.3$ is used.
- It is possible that $y_{p1}$ is contaminated with Si IV + O IV], but contribution to magnitude will only be less than $\sim 10 \%$
- At $z \geqslant 6.3$ Ly$\alpha$ and N V might contaminate the band significantly. Therefore J band is used upto $z \sim 7$.

#### Candidate selection

- Main contaminats of quasars at $z \sim 6 - 7$ are brown dwarfs.
- We ca n see how brown dwarfs are distinguished from quasars in the $i_{P1} - z_{P1}$ vs $z_{P1} - y_{P1}$ color diagram.![[Pasted image 20230317120313.png|600]]
- This is called the $i$-dropout selection (in detail in [Banados et al. 2014]) 
- $z$ - dropout selection can be used to seperate quasars at $z \sim 7$ [Veneman et al. (2015a)]
