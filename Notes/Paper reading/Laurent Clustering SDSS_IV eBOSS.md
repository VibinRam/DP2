### Introduction
- Influence of baryons on galaxy clustering.
- Baryon driver fluctuation in matter power spectrum as a standard ruler.
- 2df QSO redshfit survey.
- This paper is going focus on systematic errors in clustering measurement. Include contamination by stars, forground etc.
- Weighting maps and exclusion masks as remedies.
- Sample contains 70,000 optically luminous quasars in the redshift range 0.9 < z < 2.2.

### Data Sample
##### eBoss survey
- Six years from July 2014. 
- estimated sample of more than 500,000 confirmed quasars
	- 7500 $deg^2$
	- $0.9 < z < 2.2$
	- Allow for measurement of BAO scale, angualr diamter distance $d_A(z)$, and $H(z)$.

##### Quasar selection
- Homogeneous CORE selection, combines
	- selection in (u, g, r, i, z) using a likelihood-based routine calle **XDQSOz**
	- mid-IR-optical color cut
- Another quasar selection is also there dedicated to $z>2.2$ Lyman-$\alpha$ quasars, with an average of 20 targets per $deg^2$.
- In contrast to quasars, stars tends to be dim in the mid-IR wavelengths.
- $m_{opt} - m_{IR} \geq (g - i) + 3$, reduces star contamination in our sample without significantly removing quasars.
- selection results in average 115 targets per $deg^2$.
	- 25 already observed by SDSS I, II, III
	- 13 out of 25 "known quasars" and 58 out of 90 "eBOSS quasars".
	- Thus 70 quasars per $deg^2$ reach 2% accuracy on the BAO scale.?
- part of eBOSS footprint was observed by SEQUELS. Has some differences with eBOSS.
- Data used in the paper consists of first year of eBOSS data. 1200 $deg^2$.
