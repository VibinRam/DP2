### Questions
- Why clustering is given by $\epsilon(r) = \left( \frac{r}{r_0}\right)^{-\gamma}$ ?

#### Why Quasar clustering is measured?
- Halo mass
	- The clustering of the galaxies is not one to one with the clustering of the underlying darkmatter. Galaxies form usually in high density contrast regions in darkmatter, and $$\delta_{gal} = b\delta_{DM}$$
	- $b$ is called the bias factor and may be a function of scale at which $\rho$ $\left(\delta = \frac{\rho(r) - \langle \rho \rangle}{\langle \rho \rangle}\right)$ is measured.
	- In terms of the correlation function,$$b = (\xi_{gal}/\xi_{DM})^{1/2}$$
	- Galaxy bias of a given observational sample is often inferred by comparing the observed clustering of galaxies with the clustering of dark matter measured in cosmological simulation. Dominant relevant cosmological parameter begin $\sigma_8$, defined as the standard deviation of galaxy count fluctuations in a sphere of radius 8 $h^{-1}Mpc$. **Note:** How these dark matter simulations are done and what kindoff data is obtained from them?
	- Also can be measured from the ratio of the 2p and 3p correlation functions, which have different dependencies on the bias.
-  Duty cycle
- Luminosity
	- Various AGN feeding models can be distinguished by the luminosity dependence of the clustering at $z>3$.
- Underlying dark matter distribution

#### How Quasar clustering is measured?
- 2 point correlation function, spacial and angular
- Redshift space correlation function[Landy & Szalay(1993)]$$\xi(s) = \frac{\langle DD\rangle - 2\langle DR \rangle + \langle RR \rangle}{\langle RR\rangle}$$
- Bootstrap, Jackknife and Poisson estimator can be used to estimate the error.

#### Difficulties
- Redshift space distortion
