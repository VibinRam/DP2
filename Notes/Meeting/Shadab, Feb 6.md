- Does work on Galaxy cluster, autocorrelation function and cross correlation with quasars
- Quasar determination from photometric data
- Redshift space distortion. How to deduce peculiar velocity of galaxies.
- Worked on SDSS data.
- Galaxy redshift surveys.
- Did work on quasars from University of Edinburgh
- Galaxy shape distortion by lensing gives dark matter distribution, host halo properties.
- Isotropy and homogenity of the universe demands the clustering along line of sight and perpendicular to line of sight to be the same.
