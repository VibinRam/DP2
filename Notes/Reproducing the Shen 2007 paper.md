- Sample selection:
	- The quasars observed through the third data release have been logged cataloged by [Schneider et al 2005]
	- [Schneider et al 2006] extends the catalog to DR5
	- Paper only looks for clustering on larger scales. Smaller scales on a future paper?
	- Have taken all quasars from SDSS quasar catalog with $z \geq 2.9$. (3333 in total)
	- 2,805 quasars added to the sample from plates taken since DR3.
	- Final sample of 6,109 after rejecting 29 from the above.
