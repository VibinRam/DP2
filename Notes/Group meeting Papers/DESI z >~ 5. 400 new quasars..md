- DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) is a novel design alowing us to measure the spectrum of 5000 objects at once. It contains 5000 robotic positioners, which can reconfigure within 3 minutes.
- spectral range of 360 nm to 980 nm with resolution of 2,000 to 5,000 allowing DESI to probe redshift up to 1.7 for emission line galaxies and 3.5 for the lyman-$\alpha$ spectra from quasars.
- Sensitive identification of quasar Ly$\alpha$ lines up to redshift 6.8, which is the redshfit at which Ly$\alpha$ (1215.67 $\dot A$) will become 980 nm. All other metal line will be off the spectrograph at this wavelength.
- DESI is looking to measure quasar clustering at $z = 5 - 6$.

#### Target Selection

- Candidate selection is mainly from Legacy surveys which images more than 19,700 $deg^2$ visible from northern hemisphere in g, r, z band.
- The Legacy survey consists of 
	- Beijing-Arizona Sky Survey (BASS) (g and r band),
	- Mayall z-band Legacy Survey (MzLS).
	- Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) (g, r ,z).
- Optical data is complemented by photometry in infrared bands (W1 and W2) from the all-sky data of the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE).
- Also included photometry data from PS1. Especially the missing i band.
- J band data if available is included from UKIRT Hemisphere Survey (UHS), the UKIRT InfraRed Deep Sky Surveys-Large Area Survey (ULAS), and the VISTA Hemisphere Survey (VHS).

#### Selection function
- **Optical infrared color cuts**, which have been previously applied to successful $z \sim 5 - 6.5$ quasar surveys.
- These generate pre-selected sample with 13 million sources.
- **Color-Color selection** 
	- Color drop out.

- 3 bands are there
	- $z \sim 4.8 - 5.4$
	- $z \sim 5.7 - 6.4$
	- $z > 6.4$

- In the first year of DESI observation, our high redshft quasar selection focuses on a relatively bright candidate sample, with a magnitude limit of 21.4 in the z-band for $z \sim 5$ and 21.5 for $z\sim 6$ and 6.5 candidates.

- They obtain
	- $\sim 3,500$ targets for $z \sim 5$,
	- $\sim 3,000$ targets from $z \sim 6$.
	- $\sim 450$ targets for $z > 6.4$.
Average target density of 0.5 per square degree.
- At the survey depth about 60-90% of known quasars can be selected by their selections in three redshift ranges.


#### Results

- All targets first have a single-exposure with an effective exposure time of 1000s.
- S/N > 3 per pixel is expected on the Ly$\alpha$ line to identify a target.
- Then all targets identified as quasars will have 3 repeat exposures by DESI for high quality spectra.

- **2370** targets observed so far. 35%.

- Spectroscopic pipeline extracts the spectra from the raw data, substract sky model, flux-calibrate spectra based on standard star exposures, and then measure their classification as well as redshift.
- Quasars is identified via visual inspection and estimate quasar redshifts from visual spectral fitting. Visual spectra fitting is based on a semi-automated toolkit, A spectrum eye recognition assistant (ASERA).

- Among observed targets,
	- 556 quasars identified in $z \sim 4.4  -6.8$, including 144 known and 412 new.
	- 220 quasars at $z \geq 5$ 
	- 25 quasars at $z \geq 6$.

- Success rate of 
	- $z \sim 4.8 - 5.4$ is 39%
	- $z \sim 5.7 - 6.4$ is 8%
	- $z > 6.4$ is 5%.
- Main contaminant is M/L/T dwarfs and red galaxies.
