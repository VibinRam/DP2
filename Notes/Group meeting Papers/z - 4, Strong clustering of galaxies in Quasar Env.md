Based on the paper "ALMA reveals a large overdensity and strong clustering of galaxies in quasar environment at $z\sim4$." [Garcia-vergara et al. 2022]

- 17 Quasars in SDSS and BOSS quasar catalog in the redshift window $z \sim 3.862 - 3.879$.
- Blind search fo CO(4-3) emitting galaxies in it's environment.
- Search volume: projected radius $R \lesssim 1.5h^{-1}cMpc$ and velocity coverage $\delta\nu \sim  \pm 3000 kms^{-1}$.
- 9 CO emitting galaxies are found. In $\delta\nu \sim \pm 1000kms^{-1}$ 5 CO emitting galaxies are found. whereas 0.28 is expected.
- Overdensity of $17.6$.
- Background number density from the CO luminosity function previously measured at $z = 3.8$ fom blank fields [Decarli et al. 2019].
- In previous study, a search for LAEs in the same quasar environment has the been done. [Garcia-Vergara et al. 2019]
	- Overdensity of $1.4$.
- Also fits quasar-CO cross-correlation and quasar-LAE cross correlation.
	- $r_{0,QG}$ is 3 times more than $r_{0,Q-LAE}$.
- quasar-CO cross-correlation is used to infer the clustering of CO-emitting galaxies at $z\sim4$. $r_{0,CO} = 3.14 \pm 1.71h^{-1}cMpc$ for fixed slope $\gamma = 1.8$. 
	- which agrees well within 1$\sigma$ of clustering of LBG and LAE. 

### Possible reasons
- 3 times cross correlation of CO with quasars than quasar-LAE implies 9 times autocorrelation of CO than LAE. Then auto correlation of CO is more than quasars and thus resides in halos massive than quasars. Which is inconsistent.
	- $M_{halo,CO} = 8.31 \times 10^{10}M_o$ 
- Uncertainity in the rest-frame UV quasar redshift. Causing LAE search to offset from the quasar position. But found relatively low redshift offfset is found.
- Particular physical properties in galaxies around quasars could be impacting their visibility and detection.
	- CO emission line traces molecular gas while $Ly\alpha$ emission line is a tracer of instantaneous star formation.
	- Therefore maybe relatively low star formation efficiency around quasars.
- Galaxies around quasars could be more dusty.
