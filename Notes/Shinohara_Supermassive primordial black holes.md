#### Quasar sample and clustering analysis
##### Sample of z $\sim$ 6 quasars
- 81 quasars from matsuoka et al. ShellQs + 11 known quasars
- area $\sim$ 1200 $deg^2$
- redshift $5.88 \leq z \leq 6.49$
- Magnitude $-25.58 \leq M_{1450} \leq -22.25$

- HSC-SSP PDR3 provides a catalog of random points with a density of 100 points per arcmin$^2$ for each coadd image for each filter.
- Some criteria are applied which are given in the paper.
- 100,000 points are randomly selected.
- 

- **We confirm that the size of random quasars is sufficient for the clustering analysis as more random quasars do not significantly change the derived angular correlation function.**
