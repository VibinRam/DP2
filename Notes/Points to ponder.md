- Are they using Machine learning for target selection from photometry?
- Are they using ML for quasar identification from the spectrum?
	- Yes is the answer to both the questions above. 
>			 _Photometric redshifts (z_reg) and starâˆ’quasar classifications for each candidate are calculated from near-infrared and optical photometry using the supervised machine learning technique **random forests**._

- Has quasar spectrum been studied to find the best color-color selection function?
- Are there correaltions between various emission and absorption lines of the quasar spectrum?
