- Are they using Machine learning for target selection from photometry?
- Are they using ML for quasar identification from the spectrum?
	- Yes is the answer to both the questions above. 
>			 _Photometric redshifts (z_reg) and starâˆ’quasar classifications for each candidate are calculated from near-infrared and optical photometry using the supervised machine learning technique **random forests**._
>			\~ [Schindler et al. 2019]
- Has quasar spectrum been studied to find the best color-color selection function?
- Are there correaltions between various emission and absorption lines of the quasar spectrum?


- Why x-ray survey cannot be conducted for high redshifts?

- Look for better random number generator.
- Check the randomness of the catalogs.

- Understand the $\pi_{cutoff}$.

- Quasars have clustering strength similar to that of luminous galaxies at the same redshift. [Shaver 1984, Croom & Shanks 1996, Porciani, Magliocchetti & norberg 2004, hereafter PMN04, Croom et al. 2005]
- See if clustering of luminous galaxies has been found at redshift 6.

- quasars reside in galaxy overdensity regions.
